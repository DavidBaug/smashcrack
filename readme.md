Smash Crack is a web framework to encrypt text, identify encryption algorithms and attemp to crack encrypted text.

Smashcrack is based on pyhton and cgi and uses differents open source project to achieve it goals.

I started this project on highschool so although I'm not very prout of this code, it works really good.

The next main goal is to port this project to Django and upload ir to a reliable server.
